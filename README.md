"Oh, fate most cruel, would that my boundless acting skills would avail mÐµ a sword with which to slay this wretched curse."

## What is this?
Calculon is a Generative Dialog System in that it tries to generate dialogs based on different TV-show character's scripts.
As now, Calculon only works with Sheldon from The Big Bang Theory and Dr. Gregory House from Dr. House.

## How does it work?
Calculon uses a markov-chain based model to generate text from context discussed in previous dialogues used as inputs. There are different evaluation metrics in place before accepting a generated dialog.

## Evaluation
We evaluate generated sentences based on their syntax as well as semantics. We are using WordNet based algorithm to evaluate semantic similarity within conversations.

This is one of the dialogs generated by the system:
> sheldon: Uh, can you identify our cricket? <br />
house: No, but I can t diagnose you.<br />
sheldon: : No, you re mad at me.<br />
house: Under New Jersey law, you re good.<br />
sheldon: Oh, Leonard, you may change your mind.<br />
house: Oh, do you want a reason?<br />
sheldon: Oh, you want to go to Jewish heaven?<br />
house: Oh he's going to have a life.<br />
sheldon: I m going, and you have to offer.<br />
house: So, what are you going to trust them?<br />
